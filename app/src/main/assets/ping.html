<p>You do not need to write the command "ping" just type the arguments and the urlHistoric or ip.
    Eg: -c 5 www.google.com</p>
<h2>Some Basic Ping functions</h2>
<p>Here are some basic ping functions that you will be used to check the performance of your
    network:</p>
<h3>Pinging the host for availability</h3>
<p>You can check if a host is alive or not through the following ping command:</p>
<pre>$ ping host-name/IP</pre>
<p>Press button Stop for breaking the command</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-677" src="img/word-image-28.png"
        sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px"
        srcset="img/word-image-28.png 594w, img/word-image-28-300x110.png 300w"
        alt="Pinging the host for availability" width="594" height="218"/></p>
<h3>Increase/Decrease interval between ping packets</h3>
<p>The default time interval between sending each packet is 1 second in Linux. You can increase the
    time interval by setting a value greater than 1 and decrease it by setting a value less than
    1.<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<p>Here is an example to increase the time interval between two pings:</p>
<pre>$ ping -i 5 127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>Here is an example to decrease the time interval between two pings:</p>
<pre>$ ping -i 0.5 127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>As you can see in the following image, you need to be a superuser in order to set this time
    interval lesser than 0.2 seconds:<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112"
                                           class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-678" src="img/word-image-29.png"
        sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px"
        srcset="img/word-image-29.png 578w, img/word-image-29-300x28.png 300w"
        alt="Increasing/Decreasing interval between ping packets" width="578" height="53"/></p>
<p>Therefore, the command should be executed with su. It should look like the following,</p>
<pre><em>&nbsp;$ su ping -i 0.5 127.0.0.1</em></pre>
<p>Enter the password when you are prompted and the command should work.</p>
<h3>Change ping packet size</h3>
<p>The default ping packet size is 56 bytes. You can change it through the following command:</p>
<pre>$ ping -s packetsize hostname/IP</pre>
<p>Here we are setting the packet size to 100; you can see the value set to 100 in the first line of
    output:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-679" src="img/word-image-30.png"
        sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"
        srcset="img/word-image-30.png 591w, img/word-image-30-300x102.png 300w"
        alt="Change ping packet size" width="591" height="201"/><span
        id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<h3>Set ping to send a desired number of packets</h3>
<p>You can set ping to send a desired number of packets as follows:</p>
<pre>$ ping -c NumberOfPackets IP/hostname</pre>
<p>In the following example, we are setting the number of packets as 5; after that, the results will
    end:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-680" src="img/word-image-31.png"
        sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px"
        srcset="img/word-image-31.png 591w, img/word-image-31-300x99.png 300w"
        alt="Set ping to send a desired number of packets" width="591" height="195"/></p>
<h3>Flooding the network</h3>
<p>Ping command allows super users to send 100 or more packets per second through the following
    command:</p>
<pre>$ su ping -f hostname-IP</pre>
<h2><img class="aligncenter wp-image-681" src="img/word-image-32.png"
         sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px"
         srcset="img/word-image-32.png 689w, img/word-image-32-300x59.png 300w"
         alt="Flooding the network" width="689" height="135"/></h2>
<p>Ping prints a &ldquo;.&rdquo; when sending a ping and &ldquo;/&rdquo; when receiving one.</p>
<h3>Set ping timeout</h3>
<p>You can set a time limit after which ping will exit; no matter how many ping packets are sent or
    received:<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<pre>$ ping -w timeinseconds hostname/ip</pre>
<p>Here we are using 3 seconds as timeout:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-682" src="img/word-image-33.png"
        sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px"
        srcset="img/word-image-33.png 567w, img/word-image-33-300x86.png 300w"
        alt="Set ping timeout" width="567" height="162"/></p>
