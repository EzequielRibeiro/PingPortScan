<h2>Some Basic Ping functions</h2>
<p>Here are some basic ping functions that you will be used to check the performance of your
    network:</p>
<h3>Increase/Decrease interval between ping packets</h3>
<p>The default time interval between sending each packet is 1 second in Linux. You can increase the
    time interval by setting a value greater than 1 and decrease it by setting a value less than
    1.<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<p>Here is an example to increase the time interval between two pings:</p>
<pre>$ ping -i 5 127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>Here is an example to decrease the time interval between two pings:</p>
<pre>$ ping -i 0.5 127.0.0.1</pre>
<p>You need to be a superuser in order to set this time interval lesser than 0.2 seconds:<span
        id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112"
        class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<p>Therefore, the command should be executed with su. It should look like the following,</p>
<pre><em>&nbsp;$ su ping -i 0.5 127.0.0.1</em></pre>

<h3>Change ping packet size</h3>
<p>The default ping packet size is 56 bytes. You can change it through the following command:</p>
<pre>$ ping -s packetsize hostname/IP</pre>

<h3>Set ping to send a desired number of packets</h3>
<p>You can set ping to send a desired number of packets as follows:</p>
<pre>$ ping -c NumberOfPackets IP/hostname</pre>

<h3>Flooding the network</h3>
<p>Ping command allows super users to send 100 or more packets per second through the following
    command:</p>
<pre>$ su ping -f hostname-IP</pre>
<p>Ping prints a &ldquo;.&rdquo; when sending a ping and &ldquo;/&rdquo; when receiving one.</p>
<h3>Set ping timeout</h3>
<p>You can set a time limit after which ping will exit; no matter how many ping packets are sent or
    received:<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span></p>
<pre>$ ping -w timeinseconds hostname/ip</pre>
